1. 
To get the file, use 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2.
To unzip the file, use 
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
This returns a directory called coreutils-7.6 will all coreutility files.

3. 
mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
creates directory for installing coreutils

4. 
./configure --prefix=~/classes/cs35L/coreutils-7.6
This runs the configure command which ensures there are no errors in install.
It also sets the destination for Install when it is run

5. 
make
This compiles the object files and the file hierarchy to be run

6.
make install
This compiles install into the directory ~/classes/cs35L/coreutils-7.6

7. 
Going into the ~/coreutilsInstall directory and running
./bin/ls -l

after running
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
results in a date format of the form 
YYYY-MM-DD 00:00
Running in the C locale (after running export LC_ALL='C') results in a date format
of the form
APR 18 11:14
This is the error that needs to be fixed.

8. 
Pasting Brady's patch into a file patch_file after the line 
diff --git a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c

This is the initialization of the diff file.

9. 
Running patch -p1 < patch_file
Option -p1 because the patch file has a/src/ls.c, and one slash
at the beginning of the file name needs to be ignored.
This command attaches patch_file onto ./src/ls.c, which is the file that we want to modify.

10. 
Now, we run make again to recompile the source files.

11. 
Running
./src/ls -l results in the correct date/time format
