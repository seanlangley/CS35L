Q1
Brady removed case_long_iso_time_style: because there's a goto statement 
that accesses this command inside this file. This removal was not necessary
because the goto command was also removed.

Q2
A problem could occur in non-English nations where they would want the date 
time format in the international version, because Brady's patch doesn't allow for this.
The pre-patched version can account for this, as it can use both international
and American date/time formats.

Q3
The python script accesses a random script in the /usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py 
directory. The output to an empty file like /dev/null is 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

The python random function is undefined if the index is zero, or if the entry file is empty.

Q4
Output from command:

python3 -n5 hw3.txt
-------------------
  File "./randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
-------------------

This happens because python3 has a different syntax for try/except statements than python2.
