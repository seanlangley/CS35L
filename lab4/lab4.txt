1.
 wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
downloads the tarred core-utils-with-bug file

2. 
tar -xvzf core-utils-with-bug.tar.gz
This unzips the file

3. 
./configure --prefix=/u/ugrad/ee/seanl/core-utils-with-bug

this creates the Makefile in the same directory, so we can compile and run the ls command.

4.
 make

For some reason, running make results in several erros which prevents the file from compiling.
The error:

In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
utimens.h:2: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:374: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
make[3]: *** [utimecmp.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/w/home.10/ee/ugrad/seanl/coreutils-with-bug/lib'
make[2]: *** [all] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/w/home.10/ee/ugrad/seanl/coreutils-with-bug/lib'

5. 
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
This downloads the coreutils.diff patch file

6. 
patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
This patches the coreutils source code.

7.
make
make install
Make now compiles the source code. Make install creates the ./bin directory with the executables.
Previously, there was an issue with the futimens source code. Apparently, there wasn't any interface
to set file timestamps. This patch fixed that, and now the source code compiles.

Running script from online:
$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ~/core-utils-with-bug/bin/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

When running the same commands from the SEASNET home directory, we get the following output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 seanl eeugrad 0 2054-12-17 22:58 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 seanl eeugrad 0 2017-04-28 02:56 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 seanl eeugrad 0 2017-04-28 02:56 now

For some reason, the modification year for the wwi-armistice document has increasd by 136. 
This difference occurs because NFS Linux file systems use an unsigned 32-bit number to represent
dates, so they can go further into the past.

Local linux file systems use signed 32-bit numbers. Signed 32-bit numbers are smaller than unsigned, so they
can't go as far into the past as the unsigned 32-bit counterpart, resulting in an overflow to 2054.

gdb ~/core-utils-with-bug/bin/ls wwi-armistice now now1

After observation, it appears the files are stored in an array of structs called files.
Set watchpoint watch *files to observe any changes to the first object in files, and 
figure out where the files are being sorted, and according to what parameter.

10.
Using GDB and breaking at cmp_mtime
step function s
use s to see function timespec_cmp
operation :
	  int diff = a.tv_sec-b.tv_sec
A problem arises when diff becomes too large of a negative number, causing overflow. 
A patch can be written where a ret value diff is 0 if this value is negative, and 
1 if this value is positive.
