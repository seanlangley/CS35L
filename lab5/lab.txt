1. 
Write programs tr2u.c and tr2b.c. 
tr2b utilizes getchar and putchar to do stdio. 
tr2u utilizes read/write to do stdio.

2. 
run head --bytes=5000000 /dev/urandom > output.txt
output.txt is a file that has 5000000 bytes.

3. 
time ./tr2b 'abc' 'def' < output.txt
RESULTS:
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s

time ./tr2u 'abc' 'def' < output.txt
RESULTS: 
real	0m7.177s
user	0m0.350s
sys	0m6.815s

4. 
strace -o strace_output ./tr2b 'AB' 'XY' < output.txt
This prints the strace output onto the terminal.

wc -l strace_output
This counts 31 lines in strace_output, which means
tr2b performed 31 system calls.

5. 
strace -o strace_output2 ./tr2u 'AB' 'XY' < output.txt
wc -l strace_output2

This counts 10000026 lines. Significantly more than 
tr2b. This is because read/write performs a 
system call on every single byte of the file, where 
getchar/putchar only performs a system call once on the entire
file.
