Buildwords tests

First, get a file that contains a list of words in assign2.html

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
 | tr [:upper:] [:lower] | sort -u > assign2

This file will be used for spell checking purposes

comm -23 ./assign2 ./hwords
This command will compare assign2.html words against hwords,
including words unique to assign2.html
This shows all the words misspelled in Hawaiian,
 which is almost all words since it's an
English document.

comm -23 ./assign2 ./words
This command comapares assign2 against words, showing words unique to assign2.
Effectively, this is an english spell checker,
showing words in assign2 that don't exist in
the dictionary.
All of the misspelled English words are either
 hawaiian words, names, or programming terms
like ctype, charset, cmp, and so forth.
